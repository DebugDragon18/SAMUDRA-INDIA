Samudra AI is an integrated web platform designed to improve safety, research, and data sharing for the Indian marine community. It brings together real-time ocean conditions, molecular biodiversity data, personalized oceanography assistance, and smart marine detection features to empower both fishermen and scientists.

Key Highlights:

🌊 Real-Time Ocean Data – Sea temperature, currents, waves, and weather alerts from trusted sources like INCOIS.

🆘 Safety & SOS Module – Quick emergency alerts that transmit location and contact details to rescue or support teams.

📢 Advisory Hub – Scientists can publish weather warnings, fishing zone updates, and safety advisories for fishermen.

🧬 Molecular Biodiversity Explorer – Access DNA/rDNA data from ocean sampling sites (via CoMBINe, OBIS, BOLD, etc.).

👥 User Profiles – Fishermen and scientists can register their name, phone number, job role, and state for tailored information.

🤝 Data Contribution – Upload new sampling data or observations to enrich the shared database.

🤖 Personalized Oceanography Assistance – AI-driven recommendations and alerts tailored to each user’s location, fishing pattern, or research focus.

🐟 Marine Detection Feature – Tools to identify and classify marine species or anomalies using AI and uploaded images/data.

💻 Modern UI – Mobile-friendly, fast, and accessible design using React/Firebase (or your chosen stack).

Purpose:
To bridge the gap between scientific research and on-ground fishing activities, making critical marine data open, usable, and actionable, while providing smart assistance and detection capabilities to end users.
